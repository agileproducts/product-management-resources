With [Coach Erika](https://coacherika.co)

A first round interview comes after a screener, and is normally a 1hr max exploration of your career journey and basic potential fit.

## How to prepare

Get you career story straight. 

Know your digital footprint. Know what is out there with your name on it and whether it fits the way you'd like to present yourself.

Know why you want the role, which should be for positive reasons for yourself and offer positive benefit to the employer. One good reason will do.

Know the role. Pick the key wants out from the JD and map your experience onto that.

It's difficult to remember all your career stories to answer the 'tell us about a time..' questions. Writing them all down is overwhelming.

Instead pick 3-5 major recent projects and try to remember every single detail.

* Strategic driving factors - why do the product?
* How you got involved
* Who was involved
* Success criteria
* Why was it complex?
* What you did to drive success?
* Issues that came up
* Conflict that arose
* The ultimate result
* What you learned
* How you have grown - how you implemented the learnings

Learn the major frameworks for behavioural questions.

* "Tell me about a time when.."
* "Put yourself in this situation, what would you do?"
* "What is your general approach to doing X?"

Formulate high-signal questions to get interviewers thinking. Ask questions that are important to you. Do your research on the employer and their context.
