## Planning and OKRs

Leadership set annual high-level goals. Product teams do a major planning session every six months. They reflect on adjust those plans halfway through, i.e. alternating quarters.

_"When I first arrived at Figma, I actually deprecated OKRs. We had dreadful companywide OKR meetings where we went through a spreadsheet tracker of hundreds of OKRs that were really more like tasks assigned to individual contributors. While it was good at creating some level of accountability, it was hard to understand why any of this mattered._

_I asked teams to instead define headlines—essentially, claims that they’d like to make by the end of some time period. For example, it might be something like 'Figma is the most efficient way to design,' and the team offers both quantitative and qualitative ways to evaluate that claim."_

After hiring a data science leader they bought OKRs back in a rebranded way. But they still recognise that sometimes they are qualitative, not everything is a number.

## Product and design reviews

They use product reviews for making decisions. They either try to align on the problem or on the solution. They use their own Figjam tool to present and document.

They have five standing design crit sessions a week, sometimes inviting guest observers. [I guess they've a very design focused company!].

## Structure

They have teams focused on individual products (Figma, Figjam) and platform teams on horizontals (Enterprise, Infrastructure).
