# How Snowflake builds product

Jeff Hollan, Director of Product for Snowflake's Developer Platform

## 1. How far do you plan out in detail, and how has that evolved?

At the start of every year the leadership team identifies 6-10 'big boulders' - e.g. 'workload and cost optimizations'.

From there each product area creates an annual plan that maps to these boulders. These are generally structured as a six-pager that captures the overall state of the product, goals, success measures, etc. The leadership review each document.

We do quarterly planning to get more specific about deliverables. These are focused on customer scenarios. Customer value is the decisive element in prioritisation decisions.

One of the more difficult challenges is being clear on what we won't do. Don't want to be an inch deep and a mile wide.

A quarterly roundtable with leadership resolves prioritisation mismatches.

## 2. Do you use OKRs in some form?

Each team is responsible for knowing what success looks like and measuring it. Metrics are a must. Each product area has a quarterly business review.

Data science is embedded in product.

We use NPS and publish an annual report each year.

(So, don't actually use 'OKRs').

## 3. How do your product/design review meetings work?

A few reviews happen each week and everyone in the product org is welcome to attend. A week before product managers share a six page briefing. This is reviewed and commented on beforehand.

## 4. How are you teams organised? 

Teams are organised around customer workloads rather than specific feature areas. No team can operate in a silo. They have to collaborate.

## 5. What is your tool stack for product teams?

Google docs. Notion. Figma. Slack.

## 6. What percentage of ideas come top-down, or bottom up?

85% of ideas are bottom up. The big boulders often spark ideas.

## 7. What fun traditions do you have?

We have 'cheesy Thursdays' - cheese, wine and snacks 4-6pm every Thursday.
