# How Coda Does Product

## Planning and OKRs

"Our view is that the planning period should take less than 10% of execution period".

When they had 2-3 PMs and 10-15 engineers (no UX?) they used two-week sprints with a six week check-in. At 30 engineers (and 4/5 PMs) plus some beta customers this felt 'frantic', and they did six-week sprints and H1/H2 planning. Now they are at 15 PMs they do annual 'big bets' which go into quarterly planning.

For Big Bets they look at the most important challenges to address based on customers and data. They review them and do [$100 voting exercises](https://coda.io/@lshackleton/100-dollar-voting-exercise?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=lenny&utm_content=100dollar) to get to a small list. This Big Bets process was inspired by the insight from _Good Strategy, Bad Strategy_ that good strategy is an answer to a specific challenge.

They ask teams to make concrete commitments for the coming quarter plus a look ahead to the one after - 'Quartetly plus'. This is their template with examples:

_"Importantly, we make it clear that OKRs are not a strategy. Strategy planning happens independent of OKR planning. I think it’s very easy to fall into the trap where OKRs seem like a reasonable replacement for a strategy doc or presentation that describes the broader challenges you’re addressing with a clear why and how."_

They do ['two way writeups'](https://coda.io/@lshackleton/two-way-writeups-coda-s-secret-to-shipping-fast?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=lenny&utm_content=twoway) of ideas. The [referenced example](https://coda.io/@lshackleton/two-way-writeups-coda-s-secret-to-shipping-fast/example-inline-toolbar-3?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=lenny&utm_content=twowayexample) looks like an OTT desciption of a feature to me though.

They look for leading 'input' metrics teams can control, asking themselves whether they believe these will move lagging 'output' metrics. They aim for 100% achievable goals, not 70%.


## Product and design reviews

They have a very structured process called ['Catalysts'](https://coda.io/@david/catalyst-meeting)) for product review meetings. The team are a 'driver' and the 'makers'. They pull in a 'braintrust' of advisors and an 'interested' group of observers (It all seems a bit didadtic in tone to me). Designers also have a weekly design huddle.

They do a lot of work asynchronously through docs, writing structured product briefs that describe the problem, the approach and the anticipated customer journey.
