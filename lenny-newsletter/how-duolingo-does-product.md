# How Duolingo Does Product

Cem Kansu, VP of Product 

## 1. How is your product org structured? And how has this evolved over time?

Product teams are cross-functional incorporating not just product and engineering but also learning science, marketing. The team is managed by two or three 'co-leads'.

When I joined Duolingo in 2016, the company had three PMs and only engineers as team leads. As PM team grew saw benefit of co-lead system.

Teams are part of ['areas'](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd97f5c8-c1e1-4807-bbb9-e06637480eb8_1600x900.png) e.g. Courses, Monetisation, Growth.

All teams have metrics, but some are metrics driven and some are feature-driven. Retentions would be metrics driven, Social would be feature-driven.

It's harder to measure success for feature-led teams, but have learned how to do it. We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative signals to see if we are tracking toward success.

In our org structure, all of Product Management, Product Ops, and UX Research are part of Duolingoâ€™s larger Product organization, and they report up to VP Product. Design goes to VP Design, Engineering to the CTO or Chief Engineering Officer (huh?). They all report to CEO. 

## 2. Do you use OKRs in some form?

Use quarterly OKRs which take three weeks to do.

* 2 weeks before end of Q1: Teams grade their Q1 OKRs and draft Q2 OKRs
* 1 week before end of Q1: Areas grade their Q1 OKRs and draft Q2 OKRs 
* First week of Q2: Companywide OKR reviews with senior leadership

The areas use team OKRs as input, and areas present to leadership. Feedback is given and incorporated asap and this is always the first week of the quarter. Used to have team level reviewed by leadership but this didn't scale. The two-level struture strikes a balance between autonomy and alignment.

Format seems classic standard.

## 3. How far out do you plan in detail?

Quarterly for teams/areas and annually for the whole company.

For the yearly OKR process, around October each year the senior leadership team comes together to set the company OKRs for the next calendar year. The yearly company OKRs define our biggest strategic bets and highest-priority investments for the next year.
