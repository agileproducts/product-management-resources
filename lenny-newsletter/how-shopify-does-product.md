# How Shopify Does Product

Glen Coates, VP Product

## How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?

_"Until very recently, Shopify had an annual planning process where we’d present plans to the CEO and Finance in August or September. We’d write these long docs, but unsurprisingly, they’d usually get torn up by about March. So planning became this charade of we’re going to do this insane planning thing, but we know it’s all just going to go sideways in three months. We all know how crazy it’s been out there; things are changing so fast all the time. People who think they can see a year out are mostly kidding themselves."_

Now the founder CEO writes some themes for the year, written from the perspective of a merchant.

Each top-level team then think about ways they could measure their impact against those themes. They end up with something that looks like an objective.

This teams into a six-month roadmap, aligned with twice-yearly releases.

Every six weeks teams come together to do detailed sprint planning, so four six-week cycles in each half.

## Do you use OKRs?

They are quite averse to OKRs because the founder doesn't like the very metrics driven optimisation of many tech companies, thinks it produces local maxima. 

There are areas which are very metrics focused (e.g. checkout) but we’re not the kind of company that would deem something a failure or not approve something to go ahead just because you can’t put a metric on it. 

_"As an example, right now we’re working to significantly change the look and feel of the Shopify Admin [the seller dashboard] for no reason other than it’ll look better and we think it’s the right thing to do. There’s zero metrics attached to it. The only thing that matters is that we come out the other side, look at it, and think: That’s rad. I’m psyched. Merchants are psyched. That’s it."_

##  How do product/design review meetings work?

Use an internal task management app called GSD ('Get Shit Done'). The tool is optimised for stakeholder reviewing.

Every project goes through five phases:

1. Proposal
2. Prototype
3. Build
4. Release
5. Results

We have two review steps - 'OK 1' with directors of product, engineering, design. 'OK 2' wuth senior leadership. Usually a product manager presents as a short video and comments are made asynchronously.

## Are product and design part of the same org? And who do PMs ultimately report to?

The founder is head of R&D. He has two reports leading two divisions - 'Core' and 'Merchant services' - who all product managers report to. UX, marketing etc report to product. Engineering and data have their own structure.

Used to have ten divisions but were worried about Conway's Law. The competitive advanttage is the breadth of the fearure set, but it needs to appear like one product.

## Do you structure your teams around products, user types, user journey, outcomes, or something in between? Has this changed over the years?

Teams are mostly focused on jobs to be done. There are 11 teams in Core - checkout, storefront, merchandising, engagement. 'Build' manages the developer platform.

We want the product to scale all the way from tiny one person stores to big vendors.
