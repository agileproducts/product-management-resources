# What 5 years at Reddit taught us about building for a highly opinionated user base

Evan Hamiltin & Tyler Cowan

_"Passionate customers are a double-edged sword. Founders and product leaders pray for product-market fit, strong word-of-mouth growth, and a supportive community. But founders often struggle when the community feels—and displays—intense, vocal ownership of the product."_

Four steps:

1. Identify and measure your Trust Vault
2. Find the right customer voices to listen to
3. Take actual discussion out of the public square
4. Listen intently, act responsibly

## 1. Identify and measure your trust vault

Your trust vault is how much trust your user base has in you.

You could measure this using something like the [Edelman Trust Barometer](https://www.edelman.com/trust/2023/trust-barometer). Two key survey questions:

1. “On a scale of 0 to 6, how much do you trust [your company] staff to do the right thing?” 
2. “Why?

The answers you get can help you plan and execute new product launches. If the trust score with a target audience is too low, you might decide to adjust your launch plans—perhaps even delay launching a potentially controversial product.

## 2. Find the right customer voice to listen to

Often the loudest people don't represent your general user base or ideal customer profile.

Consider whether feedbck represents a significant fraction of your user base, and whether those giving opinions can influence the feedback of others.

Customers rarely proactively tell you if a feature is useful or helps them do a task. They treat this as table stakes.

If you decide to depriortise a group's feedback, make sure you help them understand why.

## 3. Take the actual discussions out of the public square

Don't have public online conversations. Talk to people in person (voice, video, etc). 

Reddit formed an advisory council. Tips for this:

* Assemble a representative group. Look for critical thinkers and good communicators, who will neither agree with you or be immovably stubborn. Recruit via surveys etc.
* Create a space and culture for a reasonable discussion. Create a code of conduct. 
* Build processes and a cadence.
* Cycle the membership. Set a tenure at the start.

## 4. Listen, but act

If you ask people for feedback and you don't act on it, it is worse than not asking. Only ask for feedback if you will consider it.

Create a framework for deciding what feedback to act on. You can make a 2x2 matrix with the number of people affected on one axis and how deeply they are affected on the other. Top right is top priority. Consider top left and bottom right.

Say no. Part of buliding up your trust vault is transparency even when you have tough news to share. Explain that you're not acting on a piece of feedback and why you are not.
