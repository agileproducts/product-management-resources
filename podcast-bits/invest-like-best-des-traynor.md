AI stuff:

* No moat in just writing prompts, sees lots of entry level wrappers around Chat GPT
* Try to automate entire pieces of a workflow away
* If AI challenges the fundamental design of incumbent systems, opportunity to disrupt
* If you still need to build the basic system (e.g. Mailchimp) incumbents have advantage

For something like their product, use one system. They have a lot of customers trying to bolt together separate docs, ticketing, etc.

_"Strategy is for amateurs, execution is for winners"_

You still need to build great software.

Chat UI is an opportunity - if you know you want to do something, but can't see how to do it, press CMD+something.

Cons of software business:

  * Easy to copy
  * Dates very fast, continual investment needed
  * The more customers you attract, the more features/settings/code you accumlulate, the product gets worse. You have a lot of software and you need to keep investing in it. Tension of market size va quality doesn't exist in e.g. coca cola.
