# HBR Guide to Performance Management

The Netflix approach. 360 reviews, three questions. What should you stop, start, continue?

## Goals
Setting clear goals is the starting point of managing performance

Effective goals must be:
–	Aligned with the organisational strategy and beneficial to the company
–	Specific and measureable
–	Framed in time, with clear deadlines
–	Achievable but challenging
–	Future-focused
–	Tailored to the individual - involve people in setting objectives
–	Documented but not forgotten - keep them in mind and regularly assess progress

Sources of goals could be organisational strategy, from previous reviews or from feedback discussions. It can be helpful to link one period’s reviews to the next.
Separate the review session for the previous period’s goals from the planning session for the next one.

Give the employee some pointers and ask them to draft their own goals. Review possible sources with them. Employees at every level should be able to articulate how their job fits in with the overall organisation and their own ambitions.

Focus on two to four goals. You could break them into smaller pieces (e.g. quaterly) to help focus.

You need to establish how progress should be measured. But don’t dismiss what you can’t quantify.

Establish expectations, like cultural factors.

Get the employee to produce a plan for how they will meet the goal, breaking things into time-based tasks. 

Reassess progress towards goals at regular intervals or following major milestones
If goals no longer seem realistic, timely and relevant then change them.

## Review and Assessment
Stay grounded in goals. Recognise and reinforce strong performance. Give more positive than negative feedback. Identify perfomance gaps and close them.

Document your observations of good and bad performance.  Collect feedback from others. If worried about it, document thoroughly with dates, save emails of praise, etc. Stick to facts not judgments.

Notice subtle requests for help.

Consider whether you yourself contribute to poor performance.

## Feedback

Make a habit of giving both positive and constructive feedback. Prepare what you want to say.

Ask the person how they feel about the issues first. 

Facts not opinions.

Active listening. Reflect and paraphrase back.

Don’t sandwich constructive feedback so that the message gets lost.

## Coaching

The goal is to help people grow, not point out their flaws.

Talk it over with the employee to check they agree there is a problem and want to fix it
Set a goal for the coaching. As open-ended questions to understand the employee’s perspective. 

Help them see the problem in new ways. Offer them an opportunity to rehearse, e.g. a presentation.

At the end of the session, ask them what they feel they have learned.


## Motivating

Provide a model of good behaviour. Praise in public, criticise in private.

Offer intrisic rewards tailored to the individual. Provide recognition in the format you know works for that individual.

Empower people. Give them discretion. Give them projects that allow them to stretch and grow.

## Developing People

For most people the most powerful intrinsic motivator is growth.

It’s a manager’s responsibility to help their employees develop.

Don’t assume people performing well are satisfied  - they may have plateaued.

Identify your employee’s aspirations, motivations and learning style. Do they want money, recognition, promotion?

–	What do you want to be known for?
–	What matters to you?
–	What do you see yourself doing a year from now?
–	When do you feel at your best?
Find an overlap between what will satisfy the employee and what will bring benefit to the organisation
–	What will drive the economic engine?
–	What is the individual best at? Where do they have the potental to excel?
–	What are they passionate about? What excites them?

Options for expanding someone’s skillset
–	formal training
–	delegate tasks (a specific assignment, not a permanent addition to their JD)
–	stretch assignments, design a task that’ll be like what they got in a new role
LinkedIn put people on two-to-four year ‘tours of duty’
Job redesign. Change someone’s job in increments
–	make an inventory of their current tasks
–	eliminate or offload low value tasks
–	don’t make it into an invisible, unrewarded promotion

Find your employees mentors and sponsors. 

Come up with a development plan for each employee - ask them to draft it. Ask who can help, how you can support them.

Identify their learning style - analysing, doing, watching.

70-20-10 model - 70% doing, 20% mentoring, 10% formal training.

Ensure they understand what their plan will lead to - e.g. is it realistic to expect a promotion?

Have deadllines attached to the plan. Write the plan down and regularly review it.

Have patience, create a safe environment. But don’t take back delegated tasks, and recognise success.

## Dealing with strugglers
Identify the root cause of poor performance. Is it lack of skils, lack of effort, poor approach or lack of direction?

Options: Converse, Coach, Can

Gather facts and observations before discussing. Think about what is actually needed for success.

Are you contributing to the problem? Are you seeing only the flaws and missing their good work?

Give the employee notice if you need to discuss an underperformance.

Assess their willingness to change? Are they engaged, or defensive?

Create an improvement plan (do this yourself). Be explicit about what is expected and what you will both do to try and get there.

Plan follow-up meetings, provide feedback, praise improvement

Can - if they want to change but just can’t get there, consider a change of role. If they don’t —> HR.

## Performance Reviews

Get the employee to self-assess beforehand? Maybe.

Document examples. Negative findings should be factual, not subjective.

Write down the three things they have done best that year and two that needed improvement
Give them a copy of written stuff beforehand so they can digest it.

If they ask for a pay rise or promotion, tell them it’s a different meeting.

If they are after a promotion they aren’t ready for, “You’re not ready today. This next level has a different set of criteria and skills. But let’s talk about how you’re going to get there.”

Do your easier ones first and your more difficult ones later.

Write it all down.

Understand what motivates steady ‘B’ workers. Recognise and reward in a way that works for them. Tell them they are valued. Don’t overlook them.
