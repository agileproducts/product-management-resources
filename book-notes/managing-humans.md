# Notes on _Managing Humans_ by Michael Lopp

##Don’t be a Prick

Definition of a great manager is someone with whom you can make a connection no matter where you sit in the organisation.

As a manager you must see the people that work for you and work out what as an individual works for them as a connection. 

## Managers are not Evil
Your manager is your face to the rest of the organisation.

A manager’s job is to take the skills they have and that got them promoted and figure out how to make them scale. They do this by building a team that accentuates where they are strong and reinforces where they are weak. A manager’s job is to turn their deficiency into a strength by hiring the right person and trusting them to do the job. A great interview question is ‘where do you need help?’

The language you are speaking when you talk to your manager is a dialect of managentese designed to convey information across the organisation.

First piece of advice to new managers is schedule one-on-ones with direct reports, keep them at the same time always and never cancel them. For the manager the purpose of this is to acquire information.

You need to scale but delegation is a slippery slope. You need to make things happen. Real work is the visible action managers take in support of their vision.

Politically active managers are informed managers. They know when change is afoot and how to best represent their organisation in that change. To gauge your manager’s place in the political food chain your best option is to see him interact with his manager, next best see how his peers treat him in a cross-functional meeting, see if he’s driving or contributing to the meeting.

You find out who your manager really is when there is a panic situation.

Illuminate, don’t obfuscate.

## Stables and Volatiles
The reward for shipping 1.0 is a deep breath. We did it. After this, the team splits into stables and volatiles.

Stables are calm and reliable, they value a predictable schedule, efficient processes and good direction. Volatiles like to define strategy, take risks, and disrupt.

A healthy company that wants to grow should invest in both types of people.

Tests to understand the health of your team
(from the perspective of the manager of leader)
- Do you have one-on-ones?
- Do you have a consistent team meeting? Does it kill lies and fix broken things?
- Do you have status reports - bad if so
- Do you feel able to say no to your boss?
- Can you explain the strategy of your company to a stranger?
- Can you tell me with some accuracy the state of the business?
- Is there a regular meeting where the person in charge tells you what’s going on? If so does it ring true to you?
- Can you explain your career trajectory? Can your boss?
- Do you have protected time to be strategic?
- Are you actively killing the grapevine?

## How to run a meeting

Two kinds of meeting - alignment and creation.

Two critical components - an agenda and a referee.

All active participants can sense if progress is being made, and check out if it is not
The referee’s job is to sense how others are finding the meeting and watch for signs of checkout.

The referee must listen and can not check out.

If you spot checked out people, you can steer the conversation back to them, or take a moment of silence that will make them look up from their phone, or change the scenery
The definition of a successful meeting is that after it has occurred, it need never be done again

## The Twinge
An inexperienced manager tries to stay on top of every detail.

An experienced one knows how to delegate and then sniff around to see if the story they are hearing about it sounds ok or not.

## One-to-One meetings

Always schedule for the same time each week. At least 30 minutes. Not a status update.

If a good conversation doesn't develop, try the following moves:
-  Have three pre-prepared points
- Turn it into a mini performance review
- Discuss a current problem or disaster of your own, so they learn something

If they just want to vent, let them. Don't jump in until they've run out of steam or start ranting.

If it turns into a disaster and they start attacking you, don't get emotional or fight back

Part of your job is to pass information on to your team

Don't talk to people in managementese

Have three pre-prepared points if a good conversation topic doesn't show up

## Managing Nerds

Nerds like consistency. They are well-informed. They enjoy unravelling and then maturing problems.

They want to get into the zone. You should help keep them calm. 

Their default on a problem is to build it themselves because it’s easier and more enjoyable than untangling some crap. But this is an expensive approach so you should get them to justify it.

Snark from nerds is a leading indicator you are wasting their time, find out why
If they are disengaged from a problem, is it outside their comfort zone? Pair them with a credible technical peer.
