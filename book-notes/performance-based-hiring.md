# Performance-based Hiring

_Notes on LinkedIn Learning course_

To recruit the best talent you need to appeal to the biggest possible market. This includes those with the ability to do the job rather than just those who meet a list of arbitrary criteria, and those who aren’t actively looking.

Need to be proactive and reach out - spend 2/3rds of recruitment budget trying to find ‘passive’ candidates

Describe a job as a set of performance-based objectives rather than a list of skills or experiences. 

A career move should offer around a 30% nonmonetary increase:
* Job satisfaction
* Job growth
* Job stretch

Describe what a person needs to be successful in the job.

Delay discussing pay and benefits.

Say to the person that you want to establish whether it’s a good career move, and if it is you hope the compensation can be figured out

A job must have a compelling ‘employee value proposition’. Why would a great person be attracted to the job? 

‘Job branding’ is more important than company branding.

Borrowing from marketing, a job ad or email should have an attention-grabbing mechanism and highlight the intrinsic motivator. It should highlight the EVP.

An example:

**Product Marketing Manager - Move Heavy Metal to the Cloud**

_Rethink the entire go-to-market strategy for our new machine sensors_

Sell the discussion, not the application. Let’s chat, not ‘Apply!’.
Meet good people for a warm-up

In the job description, list what a person needs to do, not what skills they should have. If they have the skills already it’s a sideways move. Why would a good person want that?

Think about what someone would need to achieve in the first 6-12 months to be successful. Think what the critical subtasks are. 

## Performance-based Interviewing

### Preliminary. 
Introduction and emotional control. Avoid judging the candidate. Ask them how they found out about the job. Put them at ease. 

### Work history review
Ask about their most significant accomplishments. 
Problem solving. How would you..? Wheh did you..?
Close and recruit. Don’t oversell the job. Overlisten. Gauge their interest.

Avoid making a decision for the first 30 mins. Don’t meet in person for the initial screen. Be aware of your biases. 
Treat the interviewee as if they were a subject-matter expert or consultant.

When asking about work history ask about culture, pace, decision-making, resources. Are they flexible in terms of cultural fit?

Biggest accomplishment questions.
When did it take place? How long did it take?
What were the big challenges you faced?
What changes did you implement?
Describe the team and your role on it? How did you impact or influence?
How did you get the assignment? Did you volunteer?
What was the planning process? Did the plan work out?
What was the biggest problem you faced, and how did you overcome it?
What was the biggest decision you made? How did you make it?
What would you change?
Did you receive recognition?

By asking about several of these, you can look for growth over time.

Think about the two or three biggest problems the person hired for the role is likely to face. Ask the candidate how they would solve them. You’re looking for the thought process, not the answer. Assess whether they have accomplished something similar in the past.
How would you track progress?
What resources would you need?
How would you figure out the two or three best solutions?
How would you choose the best one?
How would you reach out to for help?
How would you look for the root cause?
How would you know you have found it?

### Soft or non-technical skills. 
A management tipping point is when someone starts to get more satisfaction from helping others to succeed than they do from their own technical skills. 

Use a balanced scorecard to assess candidates. 
 - Evidence of comparable results
 - Trend of growth
 - Achiever pattern
 - Job fit
 - Team fit

Get interview team to compare notes and use evidence to justify areas of disagreement. Divide and conquer. 

* Level 1 - barely meets requirements
* Level 2 - meets basic criteria
* Level 3 - exceeds expectations
* Levels 4 and 5 superstars

Hire anyone who is at least level 3 on everything.
